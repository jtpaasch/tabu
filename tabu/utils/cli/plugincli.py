"""A plugin-based ``click`` CLI.

The ``click`` package is the command-line framework by Armin Ronacher.
See http://click.pocoo.org/5/ for documentation.

This subclass simply loads the subcommands from plugins passed to
the constructor. Each module is just a regular old python module
which defines some ``click`` command (or command group).
